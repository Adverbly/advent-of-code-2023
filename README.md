This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.14. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

This year's AoC I'm gonna try out bun! I completed all of last year's problems in rust so lets see if it can keep up with the blazingly fast speed!

Starting a new year:

```
mkdir -p solutions/day-{1..25}/part-{1..2}
mkdir -p lib
touch solutions/day-{1..25}/part-{1..2}/question.md
touch solutions/day-{1..25}/part-{1..2}/index.ts
touch solutions/day-{1..25}/input.txt
touch solutions/day-{1..25}/part-{1..2}/example.txt
```
